## Boilerplate-projects: A headstart for starting a side project

* As the name of this repository suggests, this repository shall be used for getting the boilerplate projects for all kind of applications which will give a headstart for someone working on any kind of project by removing the hard work of setting up the basic structure of the code for any tehcnology. 
* The folder naming will be on the basis of what boilerplate project is contained inside it.
* If a folder contains basic structure of a node project then it should be named node. If someone has to create a project using node then that person can directly download the folder and start working on the main logics of the projects rather than creating the basic structure for the same.
